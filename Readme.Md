This is the source template I used for almost all
of my computer graphics research and a lot of
prototyping.  It is called "require skeleton"
because it used the old AMD module system,
which was neat since it could run in the browser
without a web server.

I forked this little little project to make path.ux,
which has since morphed into something much
bigger.
